# BurgerApp

We were tasked with creating an application that shows the burgers that the user wants to eat or has eaten.   

## Purpose
The purpose of this application was to use a database to show the users eaten burgers and burgers that they would like to eat. 

## How to Use
Download files and run in terminal. The terminal will open the browser and you will be able to remove and add burgers

## Credits
This was compiled using a variety of sources including class notes and powerpoints, assistance from the TAs and instructor and websites like W3Schools.com. Also used the Bootstrap for the styling. One of my classmates Jee Zhou assisted with getting some of the functionalitly working.
